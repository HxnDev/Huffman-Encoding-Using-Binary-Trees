# Huffman-Encoding-Using-Binary-Trees

There are 3 header files and 1 cpp file. 

Header files are as follows:
Tree.h, Vector.h, Queue.h

Whereas the cpp files is as follows:
i180441_Assignment4.cpp

All the files have been commented for your ease. Furthermore you may also add further comments if you may. I have uploaded the Visual Studio project file too. You can simply run the project by running "i180441_AAssignment4.vcxproj".

#### Furthermore "temp1.txt, temp2.txt and temp3.txt" are simply some sample test cases I created to verify my solution

For better understanding of the scenerio, refer to "Requirements.md".
