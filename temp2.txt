After my 7-bit strings are generated, their ASCII values correspond to a character that doesn't display. Like a box is displayed in place of it as shown in the screenshot. It only happens for ASCII values less than 32.It writes and reads the value of the character into the file correctly but it displays a box in the file too.I also tried to run the ASCII of pdf char 1 which translates to 31 in binary but in pdf you translated it into 62. I have shown the output too. It displays a box in this case too/I wanted to ask if that will be an issue. If yes, then what's the alternative?I have attached my encoded file too so you may see the output. There are 3 boxes but while reading from the file, every box has a different ASCII and is decoded correctly.
